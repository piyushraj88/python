Big O values indicate how does the given algorithm scale for a given size of input. The common values and their implications are:

| Big-O Notation | Scalability | Remarks     |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| O(1)           | Excellent   | Constant time – best case            |
| O(log n)       | Good        | Logarithmic – efficient for search   |
| O(n)           | Average     | Linear – acceptable for most tasks   |
| O(n log n)     | Bad         | Common in sorting – still manageable |
| O(n²)          | Very Bad    | Quadratic – slow with large data     |
| O(2ⁿ)          | Very Bad    | Exponential – impractical            |
| O(n!)          | Very Bad    | Factorial – unusable beyond small n  |
